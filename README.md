# new-app

A simple CLI tool for making React applications, because I can't stand the boilerplating. I mainly use Vite/React, but I may add some more functionality later.

## Usage

`npx @logantm/new-app <type> <project_name>`

Example:
`npx @logantm/new-app vite helloworld`

Feel free to fork this and edit/use on your own!
