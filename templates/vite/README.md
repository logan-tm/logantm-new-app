# React + TypeScript + Vite (plus some more)

I made this to simplify new project creations. Specifically, all my React app projects should have the following:

- Typescript
- React Router DOM
- Redux Toolkit
- TailwindCSS
- A proxy API server (TBD)

## How I generated this code

(so you can do it too)

`npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts && npm install --include=dev`
`npm install react-router-dom`
